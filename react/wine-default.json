            "description" : "As with any wine tasting experience, it begins with the aromas rising from the glass. For Riesling wine, the aromas can be intense even when the wine is ice cold. The initial aromas of a Riesling wine are orchard fruits like nectarine, honey-crisp apple, pear, and apricot. Plus, you might also note softer, more soothing scents like jasmine, honeycomb, or lime zest"
